# ML-Math-Proof-Verifier
Math Proof Verifier is an ML-based system that classifies mathematical proofs as correct or flawed using NLP and machine learning. It employs TF-IDF vectorization with optimized models (Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) via GridSearchCV, achieving ~87.4% accuracy on 14,000 proofs.
