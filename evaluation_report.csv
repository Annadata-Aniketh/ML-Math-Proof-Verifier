Test Case 1 (Flawed 1=2),Logistic Regression,87.39%,Incorrect (0),Incorrect (0),Correctly identified as Flawed,True Negative (TN),"Model is a text classifier (TF-IDF + LinearSVC/LogisticRegression), not a formal logic verifier. It learns from statistical word patterns, not semantic meaning, and cannot localize the specific logical error in a flawed proof.","To prove 1=2, let a=b. Then a^2 = ab. So a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2. Factoring, (a-b)(a+b) = b(a-b). Now, we divide by (a-b) to get a+b = b. Since a=b, we have 2b = b. This implies 2=1."
Test Case 2 (Flawed 4=5),Logistic Regression,87.39%,Incorrect (0),Incorrect (0),Correctly identified as Flawed,True Negative (TN),"Model is a text classifier (TF-IDF + LinearSVC/LogisticRegression), not a formal logic verifier. It learns from statistical word patterns, not semantic meaning, and cannot localize the specific logical error in a flawed proof.","We will prove 4=5. Let -20 = -20. This is 16 - 36 = 25 - 45. Add 81/4 to both sides: 16 - 36 + 81/4 = 25 - 45 + 81/4. This is (4 - 9/2)^2 = (5 - 9/2)^2. Take the square root of both sides: 4 - 9/2 = 5 - 9/2. Add 9/2 to both sides, which gives 4 = 5. QED."
Test Case 3 (Correct Sqrt(2)),Logistic Regression,87.39%,Correct (1),Correct (1),Correctly identified as Correct,True Positive (TP),"Model is a text classifier (TF-IDF + LinearSVC/LogisticRegression), not a formal logic verifier. It learns from statistical word patterns, not semantic meaning, and cannot localize the specific logical error in a flawed proof.","For sets A,B: (A ∪ B)^c = A^c ∩ B^c.\n. Proof: x ∈ (A ∪ B)^c ⇔ x ∉ (A ∪ B) ⇔ not (x ∈ A or x ∈ B) ⇔ (x ∉ A) and (x ∉ B) ⇔ x ∈ A^c and x ∈ B^c ⇔ x ∈ (A^c ∩ B^c)."
